    <h2><i>What is css?</i></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li> &nbsp;
        <li>CSS describes how <strong>HTML</strong> elements are to be displayed on screen,paper, or in other media.</li>&nbsp;
        <li><span class="line"> CSS is not necessary </span><span class="mark"> CSS saves a lot of work</span>. It can control the layout of multiple web page all at once.</li>&nbsp;
        <li><i><span class="line4"> External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span></i></li>
    </ol>
    <h3><i>CSS can be added to HTML documents in two ways:</i></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attributes inside HTML elements1 </li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style elements in the head section </li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<span class="ul4"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to mutiple elements.
        ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript.</p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.
        Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p> 
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
